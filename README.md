Homebrew project that combines “Heroes of the Storms” and “Magic: the Gathering”.

We are a group of friends that share this passion for Blizzards' "Heroes of the Storm" and Wizard's "Magic: The Gathering" games.

We took inspiration on a Reddit [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/e640fb/every_hero_in_magic_the_gathering_form/) by the user /u/WORDSALADSANDWICH, in which they shared his version of every HotS hero in MTG universe. Our motivation was to make real cards to be used in a casual multiplayer commander table. 

This is a work in progress still. We are reviewing each card, tweaking some unbalanced ones and refactoring others. Also, we are reviewing the aesthetics and updating them to a high-quality version.

Enjoy!
