    <h1>Where HotS meets MTG</h1>

    <p>Homebrew project that combines “Heroes of the Storms” and “Magic: the Gathering”.</p>
    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>We are a group of friends that share this passion for Blizzards' "Heroes of the Storm" and Wizard's "Magic: The
        Gathering" games.</p>
    <p>We took inspiration on a Reddit <a
            href="https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/e640fb/every_hero_in_magic_the_gathering_form/">post</a>
        by the user /u/WORDSALADSANDWICH, in which they shared his version of every HotS hero in MTG universe. Our
        motivation was to make printable high-quality cards to be used in a casual multiplayer commander table.</p>
    <p>This is a work in progress still. We are reviewing each card, tweaking some unbalanced ones and refactoring
        others.</p>
    <p>Enjoy!</p>
